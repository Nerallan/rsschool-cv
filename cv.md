### Summary

I became interested in programming from the first year of study at the university. 
In my second year at the university, I took a course in developing _web applications 
in Java (OOPS, Java EE, Spring, Hibernate) in EPAM systems_.
In subsequent university courses, I did an _internship first at Intexsoft on the Full Stack course_, 
and then on the _Instinctools* - Android Development course_. 
After that i got a _job at SENLA Group in the Android development department_. 
I also participated in the _International hackathon - NASA Space Apps Challenge and a competition for Vizor Games_, 
and I was engaged in research work on cryptography and computer networks. I worked __2 years as android developer__ and during this time managed to work on several interesting and important projects, in large teams with a total of 50+ android developers. In 2020 I successfully completed the Android Academy Minsk course and now I interested in multiplatform technologies such as KMP and Flutter. In the near future I want to try myself in ios development.
